# myChat

## Project Description

A chat app for mobile devices using React Native. The app will
provide users with a chat interface and options to share images and their
location.

## Key Features

- A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen before joining the chat.
- A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button.
- The chat provides users with two additional communication features: sending image and location data.
- Data gets stored online and offline.

## User Stories

- As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my friends and family.
- As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange the latest news.
- As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what Iâ€™m currently doing.
- As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.
- As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any time.
- As a user with a visual impairment, I want to use a chat app that is compatible with a screen reader so that I can engage with a chat interface.

## Set up the Database

Chat messages are stored on Firebase, version 8.2.3. Firebase documentation can be found here.

- In your Firebase Console, create a project in test mode.
- In your project's directory, run `npm install firebase@8.1.0`.
- At the top of your Chat.js file, import Firebase:
  `import firebase from 'firebase';`
- Back in the Firebase Console, navigate to Project Settings and select the </> icon to register the application.
- Copy the data received in the last step and store it in a variable:

```
const firebaseConfig = {
 apiKey: 'your-api-key',
 authDomain: 'your-authdomain',
 databaseURL: 'your-database-url',
 projectId: 'your-project-id',
 storageBucket: 'your-storage-bucket',
 messagingSenderId: 'your-messaging-sender-id',
 appId: 'your-app-id',
};
```

- Initialize the app:

```
if (!firebase.apps.length) {
       firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
   }
```

- Create a reference to the collection in Firestore:

```
const referenceChatMessages = firebase.firestore().collection('messages');
```
